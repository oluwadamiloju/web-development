        1. Write a JavaScript program to check two given numbers and return true if one of the number is 50 or if their sum is 50.
    </p>
    <script src="js/script1.js"></script>

        2. Write a JavaScript program to check from two given integers, whether one is positive and another one is negative.
    </p>
    <script src="js/script2.js"></script>

    <hr>
    <p>
        3. Write a JavaScript program to find the area of a scalene triangle where lengths of the three of its sides are 5, 6, 7.
    </p>
    <script src="js/script3.js"></script>

    <p>
        4. Write a function toArray that takes 5 values and returns these values in an array.
    </p>
    <script src="js/script4.js"></script>

    <hr>
    <p>
        5. Write a function addWithSubcharge that adds two amounts with subcharge. 
        For each amount less than or equal to 10, the subcharge is 1.<br> For each amount greater than 10, 
        the subcharge is 2.
    </p>
    <script src="js/script5.js"></script>

    <hr>
    <p>
        6. Write a function rotate that rotates the elements of an array. All elements should be moved one position to the left. The 0th element should be placed at the end of the array. <br>
        The rotated array should be returned. ** Example: rotate(['a', 'b', 'c']) should return ['b', 'c', 'a'].
    </p>
    <script src="js/script6.js"></script>

    <hr>
    <p>
        7. Write a JavaScript program to compute the sum of the two given integers.<br>
         If the two values are same, then returns triple their sum.
    </p>
    <script src="js/script7.js"></script>

    <hr>
    <p>
        8. Write a JavaScript function to get the first element of an array. 
        Passing a parameter 'n' will return the first 'n' elements of the array.<br>
        example - console.log(first([7, 9, 0, -2])); console.log(first([],3)); console.log(first([7, 9, 0],3)); console.log(first([7, 9, 0, -2],6)); 
        Output should be: Expected Output :<br> 
        7 <br> 
        [] <br> 
        [7, 9, 0] <br> 
        [7, 9, 0, -2] <br> 
    </p>
    <script src="js/script8.js"></script>

    <p>
        9. Write a simple JavaScript program to join all elements of the following array into a string.<br>
        Sample array : myColor = ["Red", "Green", "White", "Black"];<br>
         *** Expected Output: <br>
         "Red,Green,White,Black"<br>
         "Red+Green+White+Black"<br>
    </p>
    <script src="js/script9.js"></script>

    <p>
        10. Write a JavaScript program to compute the sum and product of an array of integers.
    </p>
    <script src="js/script10.js"></script>

    <hr>
    <p>
        11. Write a function called sandwich calculator. This should accept one value: slicesOfBread<br>
        - The function should return the total number of possible sandwiches based on the amount of slices available, so if there are 10 slices, it should return 5.<br>
        Test your function with an alert box.<br>
        - Extend your function so it accepts two values, slicesOfBread and slicesOfCheese.<br>
        It takes two slices of bread and one of cheese to make a sandwich. The function should return the total number of possible sandwiches,<br>
         so if there are 10 slices of bread, but only 1 of cheese, it should return 1. You'll need an if statement to make this work.
    </p>

        12. Given that we have an array of 10 values, write a program that<br>
        - finds the largest value in array<br>
        - finds the smallest value in the array<br>
	    - finds the sum, product of all values in the array<br>
	    - finds the sum, product of all odd numbers in the array
    </p>
    <script src="js/script12.js"></script>

    <hr>
    <p>
        13. Given that we have an array of the following numbers :<br>
        1,4,5,7,5,3,1,6,9,11,23,11,23,56,78,5,4,3<br>
        -write a program that:<br>
        - removes all duplicates from the given array<br>
        - finds how many times any given value is repeated eg given an array of [1,2,4,1,4,5,7,4] our program will tell us that 1 is repeated twice and 4 is repeated three times
